# Vendored Ace runtime

urui vendors `ace-builds` 1.44.0 from the package's
`src-noconflict` build. The npm tarball integrity is:

```

Upstream: <https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/v1.44.0>

JavaScript sources use `.js` inside the desk and Clay ingests them with the
desk's `%js` mark. The non-minified build keeps every logical line below 32 KiB
for compatibility with Clay's JavaScript ingestion path.

The vendored runtime is limited to:

- `ace.js`: core editor runtime;
- `theme-github.js`: light application theme;
- `theme-monokai.js`: dark application theme;
- `ext-searchbox.js`: find and replace UI used by Ace defaults;
- `ext-settings-menu.js`: settings UI used by `Ctrl-,`, served using Ace's
  upstream `ext-settings_menu.js` URL;
- `ext-prompt.js`: command palette used by `F1`;
- `ext-beautify.js`: command used by `Ctrl-Shift-B`;
- `license.txt`: upstream BSD-3-Clause license.

No worker, language mode, source map, snippet, or alternate keybinding is
shipped here. Consumers keep their language modes beside these synced files.
The generic text mode is built into Ace. Configure each editor session from
the consumer's worker policy.

`urui-ace.hoon ++config-js` generates each consumer's module paths and
loader configuration. Consumers serve that cord at their own configuration
URL and import the vendored files through explicit Ford imports.

These nine files are the canonical source for manual `bin/sync.sh` copies.
Application modes and generated configuration are not part of the sync
manifest. Do not modify a consumer copy of a managed file.

Trailing whitespace is stripped from the upstream JavaScript so desk diff
checks remain clean. The checked-in SHA-256 hashes are:
